This is a problem on YOUR setup, not a bug.

Possible solutions:

- The most common cause is anti-virus falsely blocking the game. Make sure to add an exception for the whole game directory (where nwmain.exe is) AND your user directory (Documents/Neverwinter Nights). AVG and Avast are known troublemakers here.

- Make sure your Documents/Neverwinter Nights directory is NOT stored in OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, or similar sync services.
- If you have recently moved your Documents directory, make sure the aliases in nwn.ini are pointing to the correct directories.

Neverwinter Nights cannot run without this access problem resolved.     Steam overrides configured language: %s->%s     GOG overrides configured language: %s->%s       /gamedata/latest-resource-override/     Working Directory For Game Install Is: %s
      Working Directory For Your Resources Is: %s
    Could not divine nwn base data directory. Have to give up.
     Make sure you are starting the game with your working directory setto the appropriate platform directory (i.e. <GAMEDATA>/bin/linux-x86)
